PiCS Database Visualization
==============================
This small project contains some visualizations I made for the Robbins A. & Evdokimov A. (forthcoming)
paper on visual search. I used images from the PiCS database (Robbins et al., forthcoming). The dataset
is the collections of images that are that contain multidimensional embeddings representing visual 
similarity of those pictures. I made some visualizations using seaborn and scikit's PCA.
